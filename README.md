## 📌 Problem Statement

<img width="1920" height="786" alt="ES1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/748275d3-85b3-4a76-b5b2-8f9c6e3dbd76" />

Accurate short-term load forecasting is **critical for decarbonizing buildings**, which contribute nearly **one-third of global energy use and emissions**.  

This project addresses **forecasting and anomaly detection** for energy consumption in **commercial and residential buildings**, enabling:  
- Efficient **energy management**  
- Seamless **renewable integration**  
- Reduced reliance on **fossil fuels**  

By leveraging **pre-trained Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs)**, EnergySense learns **generalizable temporal patterns** across domains, enabling accurate forecasting and anomaly detection for **new/unseen buildings without retraining**.  

Fine-tuning is also supported for **specific building types** or **operational needs**.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Deliver **short-term energy load forecasts** (1–72 hours).  
2. Detect **abnormal energy usage patterns** (e.g., faults, inefficiencies).  
3. Provide an **interactive web application** for building operators.  
4. Enable **zero-shot inference** with pre-trained TSFMs.  
5. Support **fine-tuning** for building-specific performance.  

## 🧩 Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Load Forecasting** | Predict next 1–72 hours of energy use using TSFMs. |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Highlight unusual usage patterns in consumption. |
| **Zero-Shot Forecasting** | Apply pre-trained TSFMs directly to new/unseen data. |
| **Fine-Tuning Mode** | Train model with building-specific datasets. |
| **Visualisation Dashboard** | Interactive charts for history, forecasts and anomalies. |
| **Building Manager** | Add, edit, and manage building profiles. |
| **Renewable Readiness Score** | Suggest solar/wind adoption potential. |

## 📋 Sidebar Navigation

```python
menu = st.sidebar.radio(
    "Navigation",
    ["🏠 Home", "📊 Forecast", "⚠️ Anomalies", "🔧 Fine-Tune", "🏢 Buildings", "💡 Insights"]
)

if menu in ["📊 Forecast", "⚠️ Anomalies"]:
    model_choice = st.sidebar.selectbox(
        "Model",
        ["TSMixer-Zero", "TimesNet-Finetuned", "Informer"]
    )
````

## ⚙️ Working Principles

### 🔹 Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs)

* Pre-trained on **diverse datasets** (e.g., PecanStreet, BEETLE).
* Capture **daily, seasonal, occupancy-driven cycles**.
* Architectures include:

  * **TSMixer** – efficient MLP-based
  * **Informer** – Transformer-based
  * **TimesNet** – multi-period pattern learning

### 🔹 Zero-Shot Forecasting

* Input: 7 days of building load data.
* Model outputs 1–72h forecast **without retraining**.

### 🔹 Anomaly Detection Pipeline

```python
def detect_anomalies(data, model):
    reconstruction = model.autoencode(data)
    residual = abs(data - reconstruction)
    z_scores = (residual - mean) / std
    return z_scores > threshold  # e.g., z > 3.0 flagged as anomaly
```

### 🔹 Fine-Tuning Workflow

* Lightweight fine-tuning via **LoRA**.
* Saves models locally: `./models/fine_tuned_{building_id}.pt`.

### 🔹 Data Flow

```
Upload → Preprocess → TSFM Inference → Visualization → Alerts/Reports
```
