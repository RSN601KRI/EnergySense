### Subtask:
Set up the Google Colab environment by installing necessary libraries for data manipulation, time series analysis, model usage, visualization, and deployment.

**Reasoning**:
The subtask requires installing several libraries. I will use pip to install all of them in one go to set up the environment.

"""## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The environment setup successfully installed all necessary libraries including `pandas`, `numpy`, `torch`, `transformers`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `streamlit`, and `scikit-learn`.
*   The energy consumption data was successfully loaded, with 'Date' and 'Time' columns combined into a datetime index. Missing values were handled initially as `?` and then imputed using forward fill after resampling.
*   Resampling the data to an hourly frequency significantly reduced the dataset size and facilitated time series analysis.
*   Identifying and loading a suitable pre-trained Time Series Foundation Model (TSFM) for zero-shot forecasting using standard `transformers` library methods proved challenging and was not successfully completed within the scope of the provided steps.
*   A simple ARIMA(5,1,0) model was successfully implemented as a stand-in for the TSFM to perform short-term energy load forecasting.
*   Anomaly detection was implemented by calculating the absolute difference between actual and forecasted values and comparing it against a threshold derived from the standard deviation of these differences, scaled by a user-defined multiplier.
*   An interactive Plotly visualization was successfully created to display the original data, the forecast, and the detected anomalies.
*   A Streamlit application, "EnergySense.py", was developed with a user interface allowing data upload, configuration of forecast horizon and anomaly threshold, execution of the forecasting and anomaly detection process, and visualization of results.
*   The Streamlit app was prepared for deployment by creating a `requirements.txt` file listing the necessary libraries.
*   The conceptual step of refinement based on evaluation and user feedback was outlined, describing relevant metrics and potential improvement areas.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   Given the difficulty in loading a suitable pre-trained TSFM for zero-shot forecasting, further research is needed to identify specific TSFM model identifiers or alternative methods for leveraging foundation models for this task, potentially involving fine-tuning.
*   Enhance the Streamlit app by allowing users to select the target variable for forecasting, explore different forecasting model options (if TSFM loading remains an issue), or implement more sophisticated anomaly detection techniques.
